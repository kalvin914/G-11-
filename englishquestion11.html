        <h3>V. Read the passage (Unseen) - 1</h3>
        <p>
            Nearly 50% of all workers in the United States have jobs they aren't happy with. Don't let this happen to you. If you want to find the right job, don't rush to look through the classified ads in the newspaper. Instead, sit down and think about yourself. What kind of person are you? What makes you happy? According to psychologist John Holland, there are six types of personality types, but most people are mainly one type. For each type, there are certain jobs that might be right and others that are probably wrong. Considering your personality type can help you make the right job decision. Liz is a good example. Liz knew she wanted to do something for children. She thought she could help children as a school counselor or a lawyer. She took counseling and law coursesâ€”and hated them. After talking to a career counselor, she realized the problem was that she's an Artistic type. Liz studied film, and she now produces children's TV shows and loves it.

        <h3>VI. Read the passage (Unseen) - 2</h3>
        <p>
            The Titanic was the largest ship ever built when it left England in April 1912 on its first voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City. It was said to be "unsinkable." But at 11:40 pm on April 14, the luxury ship hit an iceberg south of Newfoundland, and it sank less than three hours later. Over 1500 passengers and crew drowned or froze to death in the icy water, and there were only 705 survivors.
        </p>
        <p>
            But this terrible disaster could have been avoided. Captain Edward J. Smith knew that there was a major risk of icebergs in the North Atlantic, but he didn't reduce the ship's speed. So by the time the lookouts saw the iceberg, the ship was moving too fast to avoid it. If the ship had slowed down earlier, there would have been time to change course. One problem was the number of lifeboats.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Titanic was designed to carry 64 lifeboats, but it had only 20 to save space on deck. Only 18 lifeboats were launched, and most of these were not full. The crew hadn't even had a lifeboat drill. They would have saved 500 more lives if the lifeboats had been full. Most of the survivors lost family members and wished they had never set sail on the Titanic.
